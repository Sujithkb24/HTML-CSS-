        <h2>CRIC - INFO</h2><br>
        <p class="cric">Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the
            centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced
            on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat (and
            running between the wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the
            ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are
            "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and
            by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat and before it hits the ground, or
            hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters
            have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles.

            <p class="write">We know test cricket is a game of patience. It is characterized by defence and solidity.
                However, India's left-arm spinner Bapu Nadkarni reached a different level as he bowled 131 consecutive
                dot balls and 27 consecutive maidens against England in 1963. It is still a world record.


                He finished with the figures of 32-27-5-0</p>

                toes in an accident when he was 14 years old. The New Zealand captain during that time was Stephen
                Fleming. He visited him in the hospital and let him know that he would play for New Zealand.


                Now, he is one of the best white-ball openers and fielders in the world. What a story!</p>
